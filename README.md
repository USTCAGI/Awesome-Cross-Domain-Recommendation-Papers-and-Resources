## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to collecting and categorizing papers on  Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) based on our survey paper: _A Comprehensive Survey on Cross-Domain Recommendation: Taxonomy, Progress, and Prospects_. Given the rapid advancements in this field, we will continue to update both the paper and this repository.

<p align="center">

</p>

CDR consists of four main components: (1) Cross-Domain Relevance (2) Cross-Domain Interaction (3) Cross-Domain Representation Enhancement (4) Model Optimization.
